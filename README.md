# Denilson Anahury Castro
I like to code features in frontend, whether it's React or Angular; However, I consider myself to have strong skills writing code in NodeJS and Java.

I always try to make my code readable so that project participants can read it with as little effort as possible. I like to follow the guidelines proposed by the community and the language I am using, for this, I keep in mind tools such as SonarLint, Prettier, and ESLint.

I consider collaboration in Pull Requests very important since it helps me improve my code and learn from the comments of my colleagues.
